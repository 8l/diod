fstest modified for diod - distributed I/O daemon.

fstest uncovered a problem with diod:  switching effective group id or
supplemental groups and expecting that change to affect the result of
an p9_lopen or p9_setattr call does not work.  A number of tests,
documented in diod issue 37 on google code, expect this to work.
It is a legitimate POSIX expectation.

In the interest of making fstest a viable regression test for diod,
this copy has been modified so the tests that had that particular
expectation now pass.  Some remain effective tests, some are now rendered
ineffective.

To run fstest, "remount" an ext3 file system like say /tmp on /mnt
with diod running with the --no-auth) and --no-userdb options, e.g.

	# diod -N -n -e /tmp 
	# mount -t diod localhost:/tmp /mnt
	# cd /mnt
	# prove -r /path/to/fstest

Few notes on how to use fstest in short steps:

	# cd fstest
	# vi tests/conf
	Change 'fs' to file system type you want to test. These can be:
	UFS, ZFS, ext3, ntfs-3g and xfs.
	# vi Makefile
	You may need to manually tweak few things by editing CFLAGS lines
	at the top of the file.
	# make
	It will compile fstest utility which is used by regression tests.
	# cd /path/to/file/system/you/want/to/test/
	The test must be run as root user.
	# prove -r /path/to/fstest/

That's all. Enjoy.
