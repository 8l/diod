.TH 9p-remove 5 "@META_DATE@" "@META_ALIAS@" "@META_NAME@"
.SH NAME
9p remove \- remove a file from a server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
size[4] Tremove tag[2] fid[4]
size[4] Rremove tag[2]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The remove request asks the file server both to remove the file represented
by fid and to clunk the fid, even if the remove fails.  This request will
fail if the client does not have write permission in the parent directory.
.LP
It is correct to consider remove to be a clunk with the side effect of removing the file if permissions allow.
.LP
If a file has been opened as multiple fids, possibly on different connections,
and one fid is used to remove the file, whether the other fids continue to
provide access to the file is implementationâ€“defined.  The Plan 9 file
servers (like fs(4)) remove the file immediately:  attempts to use the other
fids will yield a ``phase error.'' U9fs(4) follows the semantics of the
underlying Unix file system, so other fids typically remain usable.
