.SH NAME
diodmount \- mount diod file systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B diodmount
.I "[OPTIONS]"
.I HOST[:aname]
.I [dir]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B diodmount
is the mount utility for the distributed I/O daemon, which is an I/O
forwarding service for Linux clusters.
Usually \fBdiodmount\fR first interacts with the \fBdiodctl\fR superserver,
which dynamically starts servers and lists exported file systems.
Then it uses this information to perform one or more \fBdiod\fR mounts.
All file system interactions are authenticated with MUNGE.
.LP
This command must be run as root.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-a, --all"
Mount all file systems exported by HOST (omit aname path).
If a directory argument is specified, it will be prepended to
the mount points.
.TP
.I "-U, --unmount-all"
Unmount all file systems exported by HOST (omit aname path).
If a directory argument is specified, it will be prepended to
the mount points.
.TP
.I "-u, --mount-user USER"
Start a private server for USER if one is not already running,
and mount so that only USER can access the file system.
The default (eqivalent to -u root) is to start a shared server as root
if one is not already running,
and mount so that any user can access the file system.
.TP
.I "-D, --create-directories"
Recursively create mount point directories as needed, mode 0755.
.TP
.I "-n, --no-mtab"
Do not update /etc/mtab.  This may be appropriate, for example, when
the file system is mounted in a private name space.
.TP
.I "-f, --fake-mount"
Do everything but actually perform the diod mount/unmount.
.TP
.I "-o, --diod-options OPT,[OPT,...]"
Pass additional 9P mount options when mounting the \fBdiod\fR server.
These options override the ones \fBdiodmount\fR sets up internally.
.TP
.I "-O, --diodctl-options OPT,[OPT,...]"
Pass additional 9P mount options when mounting the \fBdiodctl\fR server.
These options override the ones \fBdiodmount\fR sets up internally.
.TP
.I "-v, --verbose"
Be verbose about what is going on.
.TP
.I "-d, --direct"
Mount the \fBdiod\fR server directly without first mounting \fBdiodctl\fR
to determine the port.  This must be used with \fI-o port=PORT\fR.
.TP
.I "-j, --jobid STRING"
Pass a jobid or other arbitrary string to the \fBdiodctl\fR server.
The server uses the uid plus this string, if specified, as a unique key
to look up an existing \fBdiod\fR server that can handle the mount request.
This is intended for a batch cluster environment where one 
I/O forwarding server per job is desired, not the default of one per user.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP
Mount /g/g99 from tycho42, so that all users can access it:
.LP
.nf
    diodmount tycho42:/g/g99 /g/g99
.fi
.LP
Mount and unmount all file systems exported by tycho42 without updating
/etc/mtab, creating mount points as needed:
.LP
.nf
    diodmount -a -n -D tycho42
    diodmount -U -n tycho42
.fi
.LP
Mount /p/lcrater1 on tycho[101-164] without updating /etc/mtab, starting
a private server for garlick:
.LP
.nf
    pdsh -w tycho[101-164] \\
        diodmount -n -u garlick tycho42:/p/lcrater1 /p/lcrater1
.fi
.nf
