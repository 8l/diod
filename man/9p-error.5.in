.SH NAME
9p error \- return an error
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
size[4] Rerror tag[2] ename[s]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Rerror message (there is no Terror) is used to return an error string
describing the failure of a transaction.  It replaces the corresponding
reply message that would accompany a successful call; its tag is that of
the failing request.
.LP
By convention, clients may truncate error messages after ERRMAXâ€“1 bytes;
ERRMAX is defined in <libc.h>.

.fi
.LP
An errno field has been added to the message in order to provide a hint of
the underlying UNIX error number which caused the error on the server.
Due to consistency problems of mapping error numbers betweeen different
versions of UNIX, clients should give preference to the error string in
attempting to report the error, however, in the event that they are unable
to map an error string, they may return the errno to the application.
.LP
A special errno (ERRUNDEF) is returned by servers who do not wish to return
raw error numbers.  In the event that clients can not interpret the error
string, they should somehow make the error string available to
end-application/end-user via dynamic custom error codes.
