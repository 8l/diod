.SH NAME
9p clunk \- forget about a fid
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
size[4] Tclunk tag[2] fid[4]
size[4] Rclunk tag[2]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The clunk request informs the file server that the current file
represented by fid is no longer needed by the client.
The actual file is not removed on the server unless the fid had
been opened with ORCLOSE.
.LP
Once a fid has been clunked, the same fid can be reused in a new
walk or attach request.
.LP
Even if the clunk returns an error, the fid is no longer valid.
