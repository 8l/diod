.SH NAME
9p attach, auth \- messages to establish a 9p connection
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIattach\fR message serves as a fresh introduction from a user on the
client machine to the server.  The message identifies the user (uname)
and may select the file tree to access (aname).
The afid argument specifies a fid previously established by an auth
message, as described below.
.LP
As a result of the \fIattach\fR transaction, the client will have a connection
to the root directory of the desired file tree, represented by fid.
An error is returned if fid is already in use.
The server's idea of the root of the file tree is represented by
the returned qid.
.LP
If the client does not wish to authenticate the connection, or knows that
authentication is not required, the afid field in the \fIattach\fR message
should be set to NOFID, defined as (u32int)~0 in <fcall.h>.
If the client does wish to authenticate, it must acquire and validate
an afid using an \fIauth\fR message before doing the \fIattach\fR.
.LP
The \fIauth\fR message contains afid, a new fid to be established for
authentication, and the uname and aname that will be those of the
following attach message.  If the server does not require authentication,
it returns Rerror to the Tauth message.
.LP
If the server does require authentication, it returns aqid defining a
file of type QTAUTH (see 9p-intro(5)) that may be read and written
(using \fIread\fR and \fIwrite\fR messages in the usual way) to execute an
authentication protocol.  That protocol's definition is not part of 9P itself.
.LP
Once the protocol is complete, the same afid is presented in the \fIattach\fR
message for the user, granting entry.  The same validated afid may be used
for multiple \fIattach\fR messages with the same uname and aname.

.LP
A numeric uname field has been added to the \fIattach\fR and \fIauth\fR
messages in order to provide hints to map a string to a numeric id if
such a facility is not available.  The numeric uname should be given
preference over the uname string unless n_uname is unspecified (~0). 
.SH "DIOD EXTENSIONS"
.B diod
uses munge(7) for authentication.  Instead of using \fIauth\fR,
\fBdiod\fR sets the \fIattach\fR uname to the user's munge credential
string.  This allows it to be passed in to v9fs from user space at mount time
via the \fIuname\fR mount option.  If v9fs is mounted multi-user
(\fIaccess=any\fR) then the initial mount should send root's munge
credential and subsequent kernel-generated attach requests on the same
connection for other users are presumed valid.
.LP
If the file system is mounted with a non-root munge credential,
then a subsequent kernel-generated \fIattach\fR from another user,
including root, is denied.  On the client, this has the same effect as the
v9fs \fIaccess=<uid>\fR mount option.
.SH "LINUX ENTRY POINTS"
An \fIattach\fR transaction will be generated at mount(2) time, as ``nobody''
or as the value of the v9fs \fIuname\fR mount option.
If v9fs was mounted with \fIaccess=any\fR, each new user that accesses
the file system will generate a new \fIattach\fR transaction.
.SH "PLAN9 ENTRY POINTS"
An \fIattach\fR transaction will be generated for kernel devices (see intro(3))
when a system call evaluates a file name beginning with #. Pipe(2) generates
an attach on the kernel device pipe(3).  The mount system call (see bind(2))
generates an \fIattach\fR message to the remote file server.
When the kernel boots, an \fIattach\fR is made to the root device, root(3),
and then an attach is made to the requested file server machine.
.LP
An \fIauth\fR transaction is generated by the fauth(2) system call or by the
first mount system call on an uninitialized connection.
