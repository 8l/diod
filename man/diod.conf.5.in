.SH NAME
diod.conf \- distributed I/O daemon configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The diod.conf file is actually a LUA script.
\fBdiodctl\fR read this file on startup.
Internal config defaults are overridden by settings in the file,
and some of those values can in turn be overridden on the command line.
.LP
Config settings take the form of LUA global variables which are read out
after the config file is executed.  Therefore, the values of said variables
can either be statically assigned or dynamically generated. 
The variables are described below.
.SH "CONFIG VARIABLES"
.I "listen = { ""IP:PORT"" [,""IP:PORT"",...] }"
List the interfaces and ports that \fBdiodctl\fR should listen on.
The default is "0.0.0.0:10005".
Note: when \fBdiod\fR is spawned by \fBdiodctl\fR,
listen addresses are dynamically assigned and limited by the value
of the host portion of \fIlisten\fR values.
.TP
.I "exports = { ""/path"" [, ""/path"", ...] }"
List the file systems that clients will be allowed to mount.
All paths should be fully qualified.
Note that \fBdiod\fR will not traverse file system boundaries due to inode
uniqueness constraints.
.TP
.I "nwthreads = INTEGER"
Sets the number of worker threads created to handle 9P requests per diod
instance.  The default is 16.
.TP
.I "debuglevel = INTEGER"
Set the debug mask.  The bit values are:
1 log decoded 9P protocol messages;
2 log any 9P operation errors.
.TP
.I "foreground = 1"
If set to 1, \fBdiodctl\fR will run in the foreground,
in the current working directory.  With this option, \fBdiodctl\fR
will log to stderr.
.TP
.I "munge = 0"
Disable munge authentication.  See warning in diod (8).
.TP
.I "tcpwrappers = 0"
Disable TCP wrapper checks.
.TP
.I "exit_on_lastuse = 1"
Arrange for \fBdiod\fR to exit when the last connection closes, if
clients have successfully attached.
.TP
.I "diodpath"
Override \fBdiodctl\fR's default path to \fBdiod\fR server executable.
