.SH NAME
diod.conf \- distributed I/O daemon configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The diod.conf file is actually a LUA script.
\fBdiod\fR and \fBdiodctl\fR read this file on startup.
Internal config defaults are overridden by settings in the file,
and some of those values can in turn be overridden on the command line.
.LP
Config settings take the form of LUA global variables which are read out
after the config file is executed.  Therefore, the values of said variables
can either be statically assigned or computed.
The variables are described below.
.SH "CONFIG VARIABLES"
.TP
.I "diodctllisten = { ""IP:PORT"" [,""IP:PORT"",...] }"
List the interfaces and ports that \fBdiodctl\fR should listen on.
The default is "0.0.0.0:10005".
Note: when \fBdiod\fR is spawned by \fBdiodctl\fR,
listen addresses are dynamically assigned and limited by the value
of the host portion of \fIdiodctllisten\fR values.
.TP
.I "diodlisten = { ""IP:PORT"" [,""IP:PORT"",...] }"
List the interfaces and ports that \fBdiod\fR should listen on, if
not spawned by \fBdiodctl\fR.
.TP
.I "exports = { ""/path"" [, ""/path"", ...] }"
List the file systems that clients will be allowed to mount.
All paths should be fully qualified.
Note that \fBdiod\fR will not traverse file system boundaries due to inode
uniqueness constraints.
.TP
.I "nwthreads = INTEGER"
Sets the number of worker threads created to handle 9P requests per \fBdiod\fR
and \fBdiodctl\fR instance.  The default is 16.
.TP
.I "auth_required = 0"
Allow clients to connect without authentication.
This applies to both \fBdiodctl\fR and \fBdiod\fR, and is very insecure,
only intended for testing.
