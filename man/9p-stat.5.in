.SH DESCRIPTION
The stat transaction inquires about the file identified by fid.
The reply will contain a machine–independent directory entry,
stat, laid out as follows:
.TP
.I "size[2]"
total byte count of the following data
.TP
.I "type[2]"
for kernel use
.TP
.I "dev[4]"
for kernel use
.TP
.I "qid.type[1]"
the type of the file (directory, etc.), represented as a bit vector
corresponding to the high 8 bits of the file's mode word.
.TP
.I "qid.vers[4]"
version number for given path
.TP
.I "qid.path[8]"
the file server's unique identification for the file
.TP
.I "mode[4]"
permissions and flags
.TP
.I "atime[4]"
last access time
.TP
.I "mtime[4]"
last modification time
.TP
.I "length[8]"
length of file in bytes
.TP
.I "name[s]"
file name; must be / if the file is the root directory of the server
.TP
.I "uid[s]"
owner name
.TP
.I "gid[s]"
group name
.TP
.I "muid[s]"
name of the user who last modified the file
.LP
Integers in this encoding are in little–endian order (least significant
byte first).  The convM2D and convD2M routines (see fcall(2)) convert
between directory entries and a C structure called a Dir.
.LP
The mode contains permission bits as described in intro(5) and the
following:
0x80000000 (DMDIR, this file is a directory),
0x40000000 (DMAPPEND, append only),
0x20000000 (DMEXCL, exclusive use),
0x04000000 (DMTMP, temporary);
these are echoed in Qid.type.  Writes to append–only files
always place their data at the end of the file; the offset in the write
message is ignored, as is the OTRUNC bit in an open.  Exclusive use files
may be open for I/O by only one fid at a time across all clients of the
server.  If a second open is attempted, it draws an error.  Servers may
implement a timeout on the lock on an exclusive use file: if the fid holding
the file open has been unused for an extended period (of order at least
minutes), it is reasonable to break the lock and deny the initial fid
further I/O. Temporary files are not included in nightly archives
(see fossil(4)).
.LP
The two time fields are measured in seconds since the epoch
(Jan 1 00:00 1970 GMT).  The mtime field reflects the time of the last
change of content (except when later changed by wstat).  For a plain file,
mtime is the time of the most recent create, open with truncation, or write;
for a directory it is the time of the most recent remove, create, or wstat
of a file in the directory.  Similarly, the atime field records the last
read of the contents; also it is set whenever mtime is set.  In addition,
for a directory, it is set by an attach, walk, or create, all whether
successful or not.
.LP
The muid field names the user whose actions most recently changed the
mtime of the file.
.LP
The length records the number of bytes in the file.  Directories and
most files representing devices have a conventional length of 0.
.LP
The stat request requires no special permissions.
.LP
The wstat request can change some of the file status information.
The name can be changed by anyone with write permission in the parent
directory; it is an error to change the name to that of an existing file.
The length can be changed (affecting the actual length of the file) by
anyone with write permission on the file.  It is an error to attempt to
set the length of a directory to a non–zero value, and servers may decide
to reject length changes for other reasons.  The mode and mtime can be
changed by the owner of the file or the group leader of the file's
current group.  The directory bit cannot be changed by a wstat;
the other defined permission and mode bits can.  The gid can be changed:
by the owner if also a member of the new group; or by the group leader
of the file's current group if also leader of the new group (see 9p-intro(5)
for more information about permissions and users(6) for users and groups).
None of the other data can be altered by a wstat and attempts to change
them will trigger an error.  In particular, it is illegal to attempt to
change the owner of a file. (These conditions may be relaxed when
establishing the initial state of a file server; see fsconfig(8).)
.LP
Either all the changes in wstat request happen, or none of them does:
if the request succeeds, all changes were made; if it fails, none were.
.LP
A wstat request can avoid modifying some properties of the file by
providing explicit ``don't touch'' values in the stat data that is sent:
zero–length strings for text values and the maximum unsigned value of
appropriate size for integral values.  As a special case, if all the
elements of the directory entry in a Twstat message are ``don't touch''
values, the server may interpret it as a request to guarantee that the
contents of the associated file are committed to stable storage before the
Rwstat message is returned. (Consider the message to mean, ``make the
state of the file exactly what it claims to be.'')
.LP
A read of a directory yields an integral number of directory entries in the
machine independent encoding given above (see 9p-read(5)).
.LP
Note that since the stat information is sent as a 9P variable–length datum,
it is limited to a maximum of 65535 bytes.
.SH "9P2000.u"
There are four new fields appended to the stat structure supporting 9P2000
extensions - as well as new mode bits and corresponding qid.type bits.
.TP
.I "extension[s]"
For use by the UNIX extension to store data about special files (links,
devices, pipes, etc.) 
.TP
.I "n_uid[4]"
numeric id of the user who owns the file 
.TP
.I "n_gid[4]"
numeric id of the group associated with the file 
.TP
.I "n_muid[4]"
numeric id of the user who last modified the file 
.LP
The n_uid, n_gid, and n_muid are numeric hints that clients may use to map
numeric ids when a string to numeric id mapping facility is not available.
.LP
extension[s] is a string describing special files, depending on the mode bit.
For DMSYMLINK files, the string is the target of the link.
For DMDEVICE files, the string is "b 1 2" for a block device with major 1,
minor 2.  For normal files, this string is empty. 
.LP
The new mode bits are
0x02000000 (DMSYMLINK, this file is a symbolic link),
0x00800000 (DMDEVICE, this file is a device),
0x00200000 (DMNAMEDPIPE, this file is a named pipe),
0x00100000 (DMSOCKET, this file is a socket),
0x00080000 (DMSETUID, set-uid), and
0x00040000 (DMSETGID, set-gid).
.SH BUGS
To make the contents of a directory, such as returned by 9p-read(5),
easy to parse, each directory entry begins with a size field.
For consistency, the entries in Twstat and Rstat messages also
contain their size, which means the size appears twice.
For example, the Rstat message is formatted as
``(4+1+2+2+n)[4] Rstat tag[2] n[2] (n–2)[2] type[2] dev[4]...,''
where n is the value returned by convD2M.
