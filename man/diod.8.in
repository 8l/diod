diod \- distributed I/O daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B diod
.I "[OPTIONS]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B diod
is the distributed I/O daemon server, which
implements I/O forwarding on Linux clusters.
.LP
Usually diod is spawned by the \fBdiodctl\fR, but it can be run standalone
if required.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-d, --debug MASK"
Set the debug mask.  The bit values are:
0x1 log decoded 9P protocol messages;
0x2 log any 9P operation errors.
.TP
.I "-l, --listen IP:PORT"
Set the listen address (default 0.0.0.0:10006).
This option may be specified more than once.
.TP
.I "-w, --nwthreads INT"
Set the number of worker threads to spawn to handle 9P operations.
The default is 16.
.TP

Set the file system to be exported.
This option may be specified more than once and in combination with \fI-E\fR.
.TP

This option may be specified more than once and in combination with \fI-e\fR.
.TP
.I "-a, --allowany"
Override TCP wrappers checks and allow any client to connect.
.TP
.I "-m, --no-munge-auth"
This option allows users to attach without security credentials.
.TP
.I "-x, --exit-on-lastuse"
Exit when the last connection drops, if clients have successfully attached.
.TP
.I "-F, --listen-fds N"

Only that user will be allowed to attach.
.TP
.I "-s, --stats PATH"
Write I/O statistics to PATH as each file is closed.
Each line represents one file I/O session and is of the form:
.nf

path:read-ops:read-bytes:write-ops:write-bytes:time-seconds
