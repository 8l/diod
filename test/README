What do these tests show?

t00 - Show that pthreads can independently setfsuid/setfsgid.
      This is a strategy for handling the I/O of multiple users in
      a single work crew.

t01 - Show that supplementary groups work as advertised when
      setfsuid/setfsgid being used.

t02 - Check that pthreads can independently setgroups.
      This is a strategy for handling the I/O of multiple users in
      a single work crew.

t03 - Demonstrate that pthreads cannot independently seteuid/setegid.
      This was the original npfs strategy for handing I/O of multiple
      users in a single work crew.

t04 - Demonstrate that fcntl locking works with multiple pthreads as
      though they were separate processes.
      N.B. may have to get thread id instead of pid on client side when
      shipping locking requests.
