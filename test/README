What do these tests show?

t00-pthreads-setfsuid
	Show that pthreads can independently setfsuid/setfsgid.
	This is a strategy for handling the I/O of multiple users in
	threaded work crew.

t01-setfsuid-setgroups
	Show that supplementary groups work as advertised when
	setfsuid/setfsgid being used.

t02-pthreads-setgroups
	Check that pthreads can independently setgroups.
	This is a strategy for handling the I/O of multiple users in
	a threaded work crew.

t03-pthreads-seteuid
	Demonstrate that pthreads cannot independently seteuid/setegid.
	This was the original npfs strategy for handing I/O of multiple
	users in a threaded work crew.  Not valid post-linuxthreads.

t04-pthreads-fcntl
	Demonstrate that fcntl advisory locking does not treat threads
	like individual procesess, e.g. locks are shared among threads.
	This means a threaded work crew cannot manage fcntl locks on behalf
	of multiple remote processes.

t05-mount-sanity
	Simple mount/unmount sanity test for diod (default options).

t06-read-sanity
	Simple mount/read/unmount sanity test for diod

t07-write-sanity
	Simple mount/write/unmount sanity test for diod

t08-option-parse
	Unit test for diodmount option handling module.

t09-mount-9P2000
	Simple mount/unmount sanity test for legacy protocol.

t10-mount-9P2000.u
	Simple mount/unmount sanity test for 9P2000.u protocol.

t11-mount-9P2000.L
	Simple mount/unmount sanity test for 9P2000.L protocol.

t12-mount-bogus
	Ensure that mount of an unknown protocol fails, and that
	it kernel doesn't lock up with debugging on in that case.
	This is a regression test for a bug we had at one time.

t13-rename-across-dirs
	Demonstrate that 9P2000.L rename works across directories.

t14-statfs
	Demonstrate that 9P2000.L statfs returns correct data.

t15-fsync
	Demonstrate that 9P2000.u fsync does not return an error.

16-stat
	Create files and compare their stat(2) results.
	This underscores 9P2000.u problems for st_nlink, st_size for
	directories, st_blocks, and st_blksize.

17-chmod
	Set all the mode bits (7777) on a file and directory on server
	and verify that they are reflected in client stat, the do the reverse.

18-flock-twoproc
	Simple test to check that BSD advisory file locks are properly
	arbitrated between two processes.

19-fcntl-twoproc
	Simple test to check that POSIX advisory record locks are properly
	arbitrated between two processes.

t20-aread
	Read a 4MB file with 1MB I/O's with debugging on.

t21-awrite
	Write a 4MB file with 1MB I/O's with debugging on.

t22-append
	Append to a file.  I added this test because I was momentarily
	freaked out by a pwrite at offset 0 during an append, but it turns
	out this is OK when the device is opened in append mode.

t23-fcntl-oneproc
	Simple test to check that POSIX advisory record locks are handled
	as advertised within one process.

t24-flock-oneproc
	Simple test to check that BSD advisory file locks are handled
	as advertised within one process.

t25-create-gid
	Verify that files are created with the users effective gid.
	Verify that files created in a setgid directory have the parent gid.

t26-chgrp
	Verify that chgrp works.
