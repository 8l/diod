What do these tests show?

t00-pthreads-setfsuid
	Show that pthreads can independently setfsuid/setfsgid.
	This is a strategy for handling the I/O of multiple users in
	threaded work crew.

t01-setfsuid-setgroups
	Show that supplementary groups work as advertised when
	setfsuid/setfsgid being used.

t02-pthreads-setgroups
	Check that pthreads can independently setgroups.
	This is a strategy for handling the I/O of multiple users in
	a threaded work crew.

t03-pthreads-seteuid
	Demonstrate that pthreads cannot independently seteuid/setegid.
	This was the original npfs strategy for handing I/O of multiple
	users in a threaded work crew.  Not valid post-linuxthreads.

t04-pthreads-fcntl
	Demonstrate that fcntl advisory locking does not treat threads
	like individual procesess, e.g. locks are shared among threads.
	This means a threaded work crew cannot manage fcntl locks on behalf
	of multiple remote processes.

t05-mount-sanity
	Simple mount/unmount sanity test for diod (default options).

t06-read-sanity
	Simple mount/read/unmount sanity test for diod

t07-write-sanity
	Simple mount/write/unmount sanity test for diod

t08-option-parse
	Unit test for diodmount option handling module.

t09-mount-9P2000
	Simple mount/unmount sanity test for legacy protocol.

t10-mount-9P2000.u
	Simple mount/unmount sanity test for 9P2000.u protocol.

t11-mount-9P2000.L
	Simple mount/unmount sanity test for 9P2000.L protocol.

t12-mount-9P2000.H
	Simple mount/unmount sanity test for 9P2000.H protocol.

t13-rename-across-dirs
	Demonstrate that 9P2000.L rename works across directories.

t14-statfs
	Demonstrate that 9P2000.L statfs returns correct data.

t15-fsync
	Demonstrate that 9P2000.u fsync does not return an error.

16-stat
	Create files and compare their stat(2) results.
	This underscores problems for st_nlink, st_size for directories,
	st_blocks, and st_blksize.
