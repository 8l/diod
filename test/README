What do these tests show?

t00 - Show that pthreads can independently setfsuid/setfsgid.
      This is a strategy for handling the I/O of multiple users in
      a single work crew.

t01 - Show that supplementary groups work as advertised when
      setfsuid/setfsgid being used.

t02 - Check that pthreads can independently setgroups.
      This is a strategy for handling the I/O of multiple users in
      a single work crew.

t03 - Demonstrate that pthreads cannot independently seteuid/setegid.
      This was the original npfs strategy for handing I/O of multiple
      users in a single work crew.

t04 - Demonstrate that fcntl locking does not treat threads like individual
      procesess, e.g. locks are shared among threads.  This means diod cannot
      use a thread pool to manage fcntl locks on behalf of remote processes.
