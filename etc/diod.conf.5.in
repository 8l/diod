.SH NAME
diod.conf \- distributed I/O daemon configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The diod.conf file is actually a LUA script.
Internal config defaults are overridden by settings in the file,
and some of those values can in turn be overridden on the command line.
.LP
Config settings take the form of LUA global variables which are read out
after the config file is executed.  Therefore, the values of said variables
can either be statically assigned or computed.
The variables are described below.
.SH "CONFIG VARIABLES"
.TP
.I "listen = { ""IP:PORT"" [,""IP:PORT"",...] }"
List the interfaces and ports that \fBdiod\fR should listen on.
The default is "0.0.0.0:564".
.TP
.I "exports = { ""/path"" [, ""/path"", ...] }"
List the file systems that clients will be allowed to mount.
All paths should be fully qualified.
The exports table can include two types of element, a string element (as above),
or a table element of the form \fI{ path="/path", opts="ro" }\fR.
The path attribute is mandatory, and the opts attribute is an optional,
comma-separated list of export options.  Currently the only supported
option is "ro" (export read-only).
The two table element forms can be mixed in the exports table.
Note that although \fBdiod\fR will not traverse file system boundaries
for a given mount due to inode uniqueness constraints, subdirectories of 
exported paths can be mounted.
.TP
.I "exportall = 1"
Export all file systems listed in /proc/mounts.
If new file systems are mounted after \fBdiod\fR
has started, they will become immediately mountable.
.TP
.I "nwthreads = INTEGER"
Sets the (fixed) number of worker threads created to handle 9P requests.
The default is 16.
.TP
.I "auth_required = 0"
Allow clients to connect without authentication, i.e. without a valid
munge credential.
.TP
.I "userdb = 0"
This option disables password/group lookups.
It allows any uid to attach and assumes gid=uid, and supplementary groups
contain only the primary gid.
.TP
.I "allsquash = 1"
Remap all users to "nobody".
The attaching user need not be present in the password file.
.TP
\fIsquashuser = "nobody"\fR
Change the squash user from the default of nobody.
The squash user must be present in the password file.
.TP
\fIlogdest = "DEST"\fR
Set the destination for logging.
\fIDEST\fR is in the form of \fIsyslog:facility:level\fR or \fIfilename\fR.
The default is \fIsyslog:daemon:err\fR.
