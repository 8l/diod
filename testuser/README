These all run the same way:
- Makefile sets up environment and invokes test through ./runtest wrapper.
- ./runtest runs ./conjoin "diod -e ./exp.d ..." "<test> ./exp.d"
  (conjoin sets up a socketpair and runs test on one end, server on the other)
- output goes to <test>.out
- diod log goes to <test>.diod
- <test>.out is compared with <test>.exp 

The tests are:
t01	Simple mount/unmount sanity test.
t02	Mount attempt on aname that's not exported
