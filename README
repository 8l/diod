1. Description

Diod is an I/O forwarding server that implements a variant of the 9P protocol
from the Plan 9 operating system.  When paired with a modified version of
the v9fs Linux 9P client, diod allows a file system to be exported over a
TCP/IP network in a manner similar to NFS.  

The file system that is exported can itself be NFS or a parallel file system
like Lustre or GPFS.  This can be done with minimal loss of distributed
semantics because the v9fs client (when used with appropriate mount options)
has no page or directory cache - all I/O operations trigger a network request.
The page cache effectively moves to the server system, with diod appearing as
a multi-threaded user application accessing the file system in the usual way
through the VFS.

Sometimes this type of architecture is called I/O forwarding.  Diod was
designed to implement I/O forwarding on CHAOS Linux clusters where a subset
of the nodes in the cluster mount Lustre and NFS (the I/O nodes) and the
rest (the compute nodes) access these file systems using I/O forwarding.
Diod is tested with a fan-in of about 32:1 (compute nodes to I/O nodes)
but other ratios are possible.

The benefits of this architecture on clusters are:  

  1. System overhead on compute nodes such as asynchronous page
     cache management and the page cache memory footprint is reduced.

  2. Parallel file system clients are more responsive to file system
     server-initiated activitities such as lock revocation, since
     I/O nodes are not burdened with heavy compute loads.

  3. Per-client state that must be maintained on file system servers is
     reduced because the client count is reduced.

  4. The shared I/O node page cache is potentially "hot" when multiple
     compute nodes read the same data, e.g. when loading the same executable.

X. Security

Diod listens on a configurable set of interfaces and ports.

TCP wrappers can also be used to limit connections (service name "diod").

X. Embedded npfs library

Diod embeds a version of the npfs 9P library based on a snapshot taken

Although modified for this project, npfs remains

Modifications include:
- added 9P2000.h ops
- check malloc/strdup return values
- allow debugging messages to be sent to user-defined location
- allow Npuser->groups to be null while Npuser->ngroups > 0

X. TODO
- free fids (+users) when connection fails and they are not properly clunked
- rework auth to use afid and Tauth?
- POSIX issue: newgrp + creat = created file will have old gid?
- flock advisory file lock
- fcntl(lock) advisory record lock
- one stuck fs can hang all npfs worker threads
- per-thread euid/egid is dangerously unportable? (add tests!)
- seekdir (offset != 0), telldir incompat with 9P
- limit aread/awrite size (breaks atomicity, but better than malloc==NULL /oom)
