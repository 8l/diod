| Building | 
+----------+

To build all of diod's features, you need a few prerequisites:

    lua, lua-devel 
	For config file support.

    munge, munge-libs, munge-devel
	For authentication support.

    tcp_wrappers, tcp_wrappers-libs, tcp_wrappers-devel
	For TCP wrapper functionality.

+---------+
| Testing |
+---------+

Unit tests (make check):

    ./tests/misc
	Miscellaneous unit tests.
	Some tests will be skipped if not root.
	Others will be skipped if valgrind is not installed.

    ./tests/user
	User space client and server running across a socketpair.
	All tests can run as non-root, no kernel support needed.

    ./tests/kern:
        Kernel client and server running across a socketpair,
	in private namespace.
	All tests require root and 9p.ko with 9P2000.L e.g. from 2.6.38+.

Running by hand for debugging:

    Start diod server with one export, no auth, protocol debug:
	sudo ./diod -l 0.0.0.0:550 -d 1 -n -e /tmp/9 

    Mount with diodmount:
	sudo ./diodmount -p 550 -n mrhankey:/tmp/9 /mnt

    Alternatively, mount with mount:
        sudo mount -t 9p -n 192.168.50.135 /mnt \
 -oaname=/tmp/9,msize=65512,version=9p2000.L,uname=root,access=user,port=550"
