.SH NAME
diod \- distributed I/O daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B diod
.I "[OPTIONS]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B diod
is the distributed I/O daemon server, which
implements I/O forwarding on Linux clusters.
.LP
Usually diod is spawned by the \fBdiodctl\fR, but it can be run standalone
if required.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-l, --listen IP:PORT"
Set the listen address.
This option may be specified more than once.
The default is to assume a client is already connected on file descriptor zero.
.TP
.I "-F, --listen-fds N"
Listen for connection on file descriptors zero through N.
This is the mechanism that \fBdiodctl\fR uses to pass dynamically
allocated ports to \fBdiod\fR.
.TP
.I "-e, --export PATH"
Set the file system to be exported.
This option may be specified more than once and in combination with \fI-E\fR.
.TP
.I "-w, --nwthreads INT"
Set the number of worker threads to spawn to handle 9P operations.
The default is 16.
.TP
.I "-E, --export-file PATH"
Read the file system(s) to be exported from PATH.
This option may be specified more than once and in combination with \fI-e\fR.
.TP
.I "-a, --allowany"
Override TCP wrappers checks and allow any client to connect.
.TP
.I "-m, --no-munge-auth"
This option allows users to attach without security credentials.
It only is relevant if \fBdiod\fR was built with \fI--enable-munge\fR.
.TP
.I "-u, --runas-uid UID"
Run the server as UID and only allow that user to attach.
If invoked as root, \fBdiod\fR sets uid, gid, and
supplementary groups to those belonging to UID.
If invoked as UID, \fBdiod\fR does not change these.
It is an error to run \fBdiod\fR as a user other than UID or root, 
.TP
.I "-s, --stats PATH"
Write I/O statistics to PATH as each file is closed.
Each line represents one file I/O session and is of the form:
.nf

path:read-ops:read-bytes:write-ops:write-bytes:time-seconds

.fi
.TP
.I "-d, --debug MASK"
Set the debug mask.  The bit values are:
0x1 log decoded 9P protocol messages;
0x2 log any 9P operation errors.
.SH "LOGGING"
\fBdiod\fR logs all messages to the LOG_DAEMON syslog facility
at LOG_ERR severity.
.SH "FILES"
@X_SBINDIR@/diod
.br
@X_LOCALSTATEDIR@/run/diod.pid
.SH "SEE ALSO"
diodctl (8), diodmount (8), hosts_access (5)
