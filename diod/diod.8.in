.SH SYNOPSIS
.B diod
.I "[OPTIONS]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B diod
is the distributed I/O daemon server, which
implements I/O forwarding on Linux clusters.

Usually diod is spawned by the \fBdiodctl\fR superserver.
It can also run standalone.

Configuration is read from the diod.conf (5) config file.
Some configuration can be overridden on the command line, as described below.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-f, --foreground"
Do not change working directory to @X_LOCALSTATEDIR@/run,
drop the controlling terminal, or run in the background.
Send logs to stderr not syslog, unless sent somewhere else by \fI\-L\fR.
.TP
.I "-s, --stdin"
Serve a connected client inherited on stdin.
This option is mainly used in testing.
.TP
.I "-l, --listen IP:PORT"
Set the listen address (default 0.0.0.0:564).
This option may be specified more than once.
It overrides the \fIlisten\fR config file setting.
.TP
.I "-w, --nwthreads INT"
Set the number of worker threads to spawn to handle 9P operations.
This option overrides the \fInwthreads\fR setting in diod.conf (5).
The default is 16.
.TP
.I "-e, --export PATH"
Set the file system to be exported.
This option may be specified more than once.
It overrides the \fIexports\fR setting in diod.conf (5).
.TP
.I "-E, --export-all"
Export everything in the server's /proc/mounts.
.TP
.I "-n, --no-auth"
This option allows users to attach without security credentials.
It overrides  the \fIauth_required\fR setting in diod.conf (5).
.TP
.I "-S, --allsquash"
Remap all users to "nobody".

.TP
.I "-u, --runas-uid UID"
Run the server as UID and only allow that user to attach.
If invoked as root, \fBdiod\fR sets real and effective uid, gid, and

It is an error to run \fBdiod\fR as a user other than UID or root, 
.TP
.I "-L, --logdest DEST"
